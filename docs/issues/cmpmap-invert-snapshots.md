# CmpMap orientation snapshots (`inv_a` / `inv_b`)

The deferred cleanup `PLAN.md` §2 lists: what the two snapshot fields do, why
the port keeps C's XOR at all 15 call sites, and the mechanical go/no-go test
that decides whether the mechanism can collapse after the next pin move.

---


`CmpMap` stores each child's Invert flag at construction/load time and computes
each child's effective transform direction as `fwd XOR (inv_a != child.is_inverted())`,
through `first_invert_changed()` / `second_invert_changed()` at 15 call sites.
This mirrors C, where `CombineMaps` snapshots `invert1`/`invert2` and `Transform`
forces the child back to the recorded state before transforming — a defense
against another owner having inverted the shared child in the meantime.

The natural question is whether the whole mechanism is vestigial in an
owned-value port, since nothing outside the `CmpMap` can reach a child. It is
not, and the measurement matters more than the argument. Instrumenting the two
predicates and running the full suite with `--nocapture`:

| Probe | Result |
|---|---|
| Drift observed at transform time | 190,831 (first child) + 621,383 (second) |
| Test binaries exercising it | wcsconv 106,847; simplify regression 30,465; transform oracle 2,928; bench_lsst 2,852; serialization 1,316; cmpmap 76 |
| **Loads that create drift** | **539** — dumps whose `InvA`/`InvB` disagrees with the child's own serialized `Invert` |

So the field is load-bearing, for a reason that survives the ownership change: a
C dump records **two independent bits** — the parent's snapshot and the child's
own flag — and 539 loads in the reference corpus carry them disagreeing. A
loaded `CmpMap` can therefore be in a state the port's own constructor cannot
produce (`CmpMap::new` always sets `inv_a = first.is_inverted()`, so drift is
false for anything the port builds itself). Reading those dumps correctly needs
both fields and the XOR.

What *is* separable is a second, distinct use of the same field. The simplifier
calls `set_first_orientation` / `set_second_orientation` (6 sites in
`simplify.rs` and `winmap_merge.rs`) to flip a child's stored Invert while
deliberately leaving `inv_a` untouched. Their only effect is to shape the dump
so it matches what C emits, which is C's aliasing bookkeeping reproduced on
purpose.

**No simplification rule depends on them — measured, not assumed.** Disabling
just the flip in both setters (keeping their `IsSimp` clear, so the two effects
stay separate) leaves the simplify regression harness reporting, over 427
fixtures:

```
0 equal() failures, 0 transform failures, 8 serialization failures
```

The harness checks structural equality against C's `.simp`, numerical transform
equivalence, and byte-exact dump independently, so the merges produce the same
mapping and only the serialized form drifts. Across the whole suite the damage
is 7 tests of 3294, every one a dump comparison: 5 wcsconv native byte diffs
(missing `INVERT_A= 1` cards), the simplify harness's 8 fixtures, and
`test_cmpmap`'s `parallel_with_inverted_cmpmap_child_canonicalises_for_serialisation`.

That follows from where the calls sit: merge rules never see a child inside a
CmpMap, because `flatten` decomposes the tree into a flat `(mapping, invert)`
list first and merging happens there. `set_*_orientation` runs during
`reconstruct`, after every simplification decision is made.

`invert_into_structure` was expected to be the load-bearing half, and measurement
says otherwise. Forcing the simplifier's `apply_effective` to always take the
cheap `m.invert()` flag toggle — never the structural rewrite — leaves the entire
suite green: 3294 passed, 0 failed, including all 194 wcsconv byte comparisons,
427 simplify fixtures at 0 serialization failures, and 1,606 transform-oracle
sections. Instrumenting the branch instead shows it is reached **once** in the
whole suite, from one simplify fixture, in the `kind=Series, series=false` case.
Its `Parallel` arm — which the eleven-line comment above it is entirely about,
describing how C descends to the deepest parallel CmpMap wrapping leaves — is
never reached at all.

That is "unexercised", which is not the same as "wrong to have": the corpus
largely co-evolved with this port, so it may simply lack the shape the branch
defends against (the H10/H11 concern). But combined with the C-side reading it
is hard to see what the branch buys, and it should be either deleted or given
the fixture that justifies it.

`canonicalize_inverted_cmpmaps` and `normalize_unitmap_children` were untested
here; both have since been deleted (PLAN.md §10.15, §10.22). This is the
`IsSimp` situation exactly (see H3 in `docs/porting-hazards.md`): one field
serving both a semantic role and a serialization role. `IsSimp` was split into
`is_simple_serial` and `has_been_simplified`; Invert has not been split.

**A unification pathway (proposal).** The 30-odd touch points are a consequence
of *which* of two equivalent encodings the port chose, not of the format's
complexity. The format carries two bits per child:

- **E** — the effective direction, written as `InvA`/`InvB` on the parent.
- **S** — the orientation the child is serialized in, written as the child's own
  `Invert`.

*Encoding A (current).* Store the child in orientation **S**; keep **E** in
`inv_a`. Every transform then needs the effective direction recovered as
`fwd XOR (inv_a != child.is_inverted())` — which is exactly the shape all 16
call sites have. The artifact is threaded through the transform path, and six
further functions mutate children to keep S right for the dump.

*Encoding B (proposed).* Store the child in orientation **E**, so
`inv_a == child.is_inverted()` holds as an invariant and drift is structurally
impossible. Keep **S** in a dump-only field, e.g.
`dump_child_inverted: (bool, bool)`. Then:

| | Encoding A | Encoding B |
|---|---|---|
| Transform | `fwd != drift` at 16 sites | plain `fwd`; the two `*_invert_changed` helpers disappear |
| Semantic state | `inv_a`/`inv_b` fields | derived from the child; no separate field |
| Load | read `InvA`; leave child as-is | read `InvA`; invert the child to match; record S |
| Dump | write `inv_a`; child dumps itself | write `child.is_inverted()`; patch the child's node `Invert` to S |
| Dump shaping | 6 functions mutating children | set one field |

The whole artifact then lives in one field plus one line each in `to_node` and
`from_node`, instead of being spread across the transform path.

**Why this is worth doing regardless of upstream.** Under encoding A, retiring
the artifact means touching all 16 transform sites. Under encoding B it means
deleting one field and two lines. So B is both simpler now *and* the thing that
makes the eventual collapse trivial — it does not depend on C changing.

**Status: attempted; the decode step landed, the encoding change is blocked.**

`63782ac` did the part that stands alone: the sixteen inline decodes across
eleven functions are now two functions, `CmpMap::first_dir` / `second_dir`.
Behavior-preserving, verified against every byte-exact corpus with no fixture
regeneration. That reduces the encoding change from a sixteen-site sweep to a
two-function edit.

**The blocker, found by attempting it.** Encoding B needs the child stored in
its *effective* orientation, so load must flip a child whose serialized
orientation disagrees. The only way to flip is `Mapping::invert`, and every
implementation deliberately clears the simplification tags:

```rust
fn invert(&mut self) {
    self.inverted = !self.inverted;
    // C astSetInvert clears IsSimple
    self.has_been_simplified = false;
}
```

So normalizing at load would clear each child's `IsSimp` and change the dump —
byte-exactness lost. Avoiding that needs a tag-preserving flag setter, which
means a new method on `Mapping` implemented by **37 classes**, whose entire
purpose is to bypass a clear that exists to mirror `astSetInvert`.

**That is the real finding: the two artifacts are coupled.** The `InvA`/`InvB`
cleanup cannot land before the `IsSimp` artifact is resolved, because the
mechanism it needs is a hole in `IsSimp`'s own emulation. It is not a
coincidence that these two clusters were the port's most expensive area — each
one's workaround is load-bearing for the other's.

**Revised sequencing.** Do not attempt encoding B in isolation. Either:

1. Resolve `IsSimp` first — if upstream's deterministic-placement fix removes the
   need for the dual-flag split, `invert()` no longer has a tag to clear, the
   37-class method is unnecessary, and encoding B becomes a local change; or
2. Do both together, after the §8 pin move, as one behavior-preserving refactor
   gated on the regenerated corpora.

The remaining risks, unchanged and still to work through when it is attempted:

- Patching the child's `Invert` in the emitted node must honor C's
  write-when-set convention (`Dump` writes `InvA` only when non-zero), or
  byte-exactness breaks on the "flag absent" cases.
- Nested CmpMaps: patching a child node's `Invert` must not disturb that
  child's own `InvA`/`InvB`.
- `equal()` and the simplifier's fingerprint read `inv_a`; both need review
  against the derived value. There are ~24 external readers of `inv_a()` /
  `inv_b()` across `simplify.rs`, `winmap_merge.rs`, `regions/mod.rs` and
  `fitschan/fset_to_store/`; most compute the drift expression and would
  simplify, but each needs checking.
- `TranMap` carries the same `inv_a`/`inv_b` pattern and would need the same
  treatment for the cleanup to be complete.

**Sequencing.** Do it as a behavior-preserving refactor with the byte-exact
corpus as the gate — wcsconv 194, the 427 simplify fixtures and the 1,606
oracle sections should all stay green with no fixture regeneration, because
encoding B emits the same bytes. That makes it independently verifiable, unlike
the collapse, which needs the pin to move first.

**Where the state comes from in C.** `CombineMaps` (`cmpmap.c:527`) clones
rather than copies the components, temporarily sets each child's `Invert` to the
effective direction, lets the constructor snapshot it into the CmpMap's own
`invert1`/`invert2`, and then *restores the child's own flag* so the caller does
not find its Mapping altered. Because the child is shared, that restoration is
visible through the parent: the CmpMap's snapshot holds the effective direction
while the child's own flag holds the original. `Dump` writes both. The
disagreement the port must honor is therefore a courtesy to a caller holding a
shared pointer — a requirement that cannot arise under exclusive ownership.
Written up for upstream in `docs/issues/c-library-quirks.md`.

**Why it is deferred, and the test that settles it.** The read path is currently
required for byte-exactness, so nothing can be simplified today. But upstream is
removing sources of this state: `f54ff1b7` ("fitschan: do not invert an
encapsulated PermMap in `WcsNative`") and the deterministic-`IsSimp` change on
`u/timj/misc-bugs` both eliminate cases where C's dump records a flag the
Mapping itself does not justify — the two quirks in
`docs/issues/c-library-quirks.md` the port declined to mirror.

The go/no-go test is mechanical: **after the §8 pin move and corpus
regeneration, re-run the load-drift probe.** If the 539 goes to zero, then no
dump in the corpus carries disagreeing bits any more, and the mechanism can
collapse — maintain `inv_a == child.is_inverted()` as an invariant, drop the XOR
from all 15 sites, and replace the 6 dump-shaping calls with an ordinary
child inversion. If it stays non-zero, the mechanism is permanent and the doc
comments should say so rather than reading as scaffolding. Do not attempt either
before wcsconv, the simplify corpus and the transform oracle are all green
against the regenerated fixtures.
