# PLAN.md — Rust AST port: outstanding-work clearing house

Ticket DM-54793. This file is the single index of active, audited, outstanding
work in the Rust port. When a gap is found and written up, link it here so the
write-up is discoverable and does not go stale in isolation. When work lands,
update the status column (and, when a whole area closes, strike it through with
the closing commit).

Convention: detailed analysis lives in `docs/audits/` (structured gap sweeps) or
`docs/issues/` (per-subsystem port-gap catalogues). This file holds only the
one-line pointer and current status for each.

## 1. Region classes

| Area | Doc | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 5 cross-cutting parity (simplify / uncertainty machinery) | `docs/audits/region-phase5-parity-spec.md` | **CLOSED** — all 8 gaps landed (RB-PICK/MERGE-FF/SETUNC/DEFUNC/SIMP-STAB/CE-FIT + R-UNC/PR-MAP by refactor); final commit `a96bc80` |
| 4 critical `equal()` failures + shared root-cause primitives (R-PINS, R-OVL) | `docs/audits/region-synthesis-plan.md` | **CLOSED** — all 4 fixtures pass; `d834b81` closed the last (cap_slamap_07) |
| Post-Phase-5 coverage sweep (broader vtab override audit) | `docs/audits/region-class-coverage-audit.md` | OPEN — 7 findings, none a current red gate; see below |

Per-area source audits feeding the two closed docs above (kept for reference):
`region-base.md`, `region-box-interval-pointlist.md`,
`region-circle-ellipse-polygon-null.md`, `region-cmpregion-prism.md`.

### Outstanding region findings (from the coverage sweep)

Detail and C↔Rust locations in `docs/audits/region-class-coverage-audit.md`.

| ID | Gap | Gated behind | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| MESH-GEO | Polygon `reg_base_mesh` planar not geodesic (polygon.rs:623 vs polygon.c:4329) | — (latent; sky-polygon fixture) | highest — affects overlap/MOC when reached |
| PLY-DOWN | Polygon `Downsize`/`DownsizePoly` unported; verify Simplify vertex reduction | — (latent; serialization parity) | high — confirm before scheduling |
| GRID-FRM | `reg_base_grid` generic odometer, no Frame-aware `astFrameGrid` (data.rs:354) | Frame work | medium |
| BND-INT | Interval `BndBaseMesh` override missing (overlap.rs:376 vs interval.c:215) | overlap pass | medium |
| RT-TRACE | `RegTrace` boundary tracing unported (base + 6 classes) | Plot/Grf backend | deferred |
| RS-SPLIT | CmpRegion `RegSplit` disjoint split unported (cmpregion.c:2472) | Plot/Grf backend | deferred |
| ACC-PARS | Geometry accessors (`CirclePars` etc.) unexposed | STC-S | deferred |

## 2. Frames and Mappings

| Area | Doc | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Frame + Mapping class C-port gaps (function-by-function) | `docs/issues/frame-mapping-c-port-gaps.md` | audit COMPLETE; work items tracked within |
| Mapping implementation gaps vs C oracle | `docs/mapping-gaps-audit.md` | OPEN |
| Per-class Mapping performance vs C oracle | `docs/issues/mapping-perf-vs-c-oracle.md` | OPEN — inverse-transform 1.7× gap has known path |
| WcsMap NAXIS refactor | `docs/issues/wcsmap-naxis-refactor.md` | OPEN |
| TimeFrame port + Epoch/Equinox API | `docs/issues/timeframe-and-epoch-api-port.md` | OPEN |
| TimeFrame unformat findings | `docs/issues/timeframe-unformat-findings.md` | OPEN |

## 3. Simplifier

| Area | Doc | Status |
|---|---|---|
| MapMerge rebuild plan | `docs/issues/simplifier-mapmerge-rebuild-plan.md` | OPEN |
| WinMap inverted-merge bug | `docs/issues/simplifier-winmap-inverted-merge-bug.md` | OPEN |
| Simplify serialization gaps | `docs/issues/simplify-serialization-gaps.md` | OPEN |
| SphMap fwd/inv unit-radius cancellation analysis | `docs/issues/sph_fwd_inv_unitradius_cancel_analysis.md` | OPEN |

## 4. Serialization / FITS / round-trip

| Area | Doc | Status |
|---|---|---|
| FitsChan C-port gaps | `docs/issues/fitschan-c-port-gaps.md` | OPEN |
| Native round-trip gaps | `docs/issues/native-roundtrip-gaps.md` | OPEN |
| Native round-trip simplify gaps | `docs/issues/native-roundtrip-simplify-gaps.md` | OPEN |
| `fset_to_store` port gaps | `docs/issues/fset_to_store-port-gaps.md` | OPEN |
| wcsconv residual classification | `docs/issues/wcsconv-residual-classification.md` | OPEN |

## 5. Cross-cutting

| Area | Doc | Status |
|---|---|---|
| C-library quirks mirrored in the port | `docs/issues/c-library-quirks.md` | running list — discuss with upstream |

## C → Rust test migration tracker

| C test (`ast_tester/`) | Rust counterpart | Status |
|---|---|---|
| testconvert.c | crates/ast-core/tests/test_convert.rs | ported 2026-06-12 |
| testframe.c | (deferred) | NormUnit(1) via capi units layer; orthogonal to the Frame-base port |
